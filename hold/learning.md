<h3 id="what_is_javascript">What is JavaScript?</h3>

JavaScript is a **programming language** commonly used to make web pages interactive.

Here’s the simple breakdown:

* **Runs in the browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
* **Adds interactivity** to websites—like dropdowns, sliders, form validation, animations.
* **Works alongside HTML and CSS** to build modern web applications.
* **Also runs on servers** using environments like **Node.js**.
* **Event-driven and dynamic**, meaning it can react instantly to user actions.
* **One of the core technologies of the web**, used almost everywhere.

If you want, I can also explain:
✔ how JavaScript works under the hood
✔ key concepts (DOM, events, variables, functions)
✔ differences between JavaScript and jQuery
✔ examples with jQuery (since you prefer that)

Just tell me!


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_are_javascript_data_types">What are JavaScript data types?</h3>


JavaScript has **8 main data types**. They fall into two categories: **primitive** and **non-primitive**.

---

## ✅ **Primitive Data Types (7 types)**

These hold a **single value** and are **immutable**.

1. **String**
   Text values.

   ```js
   let name = "John";
   ```

2. **Number**
   All numbers (integer, float, etc.).

   ```js
   let age = 25;
   ```

3. **BigInt**
   Large integers beyond Number limits.

   ```js
   let big = 12345678901234567890n;
   ```

4. **Boolean**
   Only `true` or `false`.

   ```js
   let isActive = true;
   ```

5. **Undefined**
   A variable declared but not assigned.

   ```js
   let x; // undefined
   ```

6. **Null**
   Intentional “empty” value.

   ```js
   let data = null;
   ```

7. **Symbol**
   Unique identifiers used mostly in advanced JS.

   ```js
   let id = Symbol("id");
   ```

---

## ✅ **Non-Primitive Data Type (1 type)**

8. **Object**
   Collections of key–value pairs.

   ```js
   let user = { name: "John", age: 20 };
   ```

Arrays, functions, dates—all are technically **objects**.




<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_difference_between_var_let_and_const">What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?</h3>


Here’s a clear and simple explanation of the differences between **`var`**, **`let`**, and **`const`** in JavaScript:

## ✅ **1. Scope**

| Keyword   | Scope Type     | Meaning                                  |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **var**   | Function scope | Visible inside the entire function.      |
| **let**   | Block scope    | Visible only inside `{ }` blocks.        |
| **const** | Block scope    | Same as `let`, but cannot be reassigned. |

---

## ✅ **2. Reassignment**

| Keyword   | Reassign Value?                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **var**   | ✔ Yes                                   |
| **let**   | ✔ Yes                                   |
| **const** | ❌ No (but object contents *can* change) |

Example for `const` object:

```js
const user = { name: "John" };
user.name = "Peter"; // allowed
user = {}; // ❌ not allowed
```

---

## ✅ **3. Hoisting Behavior**

| Keyword   | Hoisted? | Usable Before Declaration?         |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **var**   | ✔ Yes    | ✔ Allowed (value = undefined)      |
| **let**   | ✔ Yes    | ❌ Not allowed (Temporal Dead Zone) |
| **const** | ✔ Yes    | ❌ Not allowed (TDZ)                |

Example:

```js
console.log(a); // undefined (var is hoisted)
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // ❌ error (let not usable before declare)
let b = 20;
```

---

## ✅ **4. Use Cases (Best Practices)**

* **Use `let`** for variables that will change.
* **Use `const`** for values that should not change.
* **Avoid `var`** in modern JavaScript (causes unexpected behavior).



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_hoisting">What is hoisting?</h3>


**Hoisting** is JavaScript’s behavior of **moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope** *before the code executes*.

In simple words:

> JavaScript reads all declarations first, then runs the code.

---

## ✅ **How hoisting works**

Only **declarations** are hoisted — **not** assignments.

### Example with `var`

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

Behind the scenes:

```js
var a;        // hoisted
console.log(a);
a = 10;       // assignment stays here
```

---

## ✅ **Hoisting with `let` and `const`**

They are hoisted too, **but not initialized**, so you cannot use them before the declaration.

```js
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 20;
```

This happens because of the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**, the period before the variable is declared.

---

## ✅ **Hoisting with functions**

Function **declarations are fully hoisted**:

```js
sayHello(); // works

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

But **function expressions** are not hoisted like declarations:

```js
sayHi(); // ❌ TypeError
var sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
```

---

## 🚀 Summary

| Type                 | Hoisted?            | Usable Before Declaration? |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `var`                | ✔ Yes               | ✔ Yes (value = undefined)  |
| `let`                | ✔ Yes               | ❌ No (TDZ)                 |
| `const`              | ✔ Yes               | ❌ No (TDZ)                 |
| Function Declaration | ✔ Yes               | ✔ Yes                      |
| Function Expression  | ✔ Yes (as variable) | ❌ No                       |

---

If you want, I can also explain:
✔ TDZ with examples
✔ Hoisting in jQuery callbacks
✔ Common interview questions on hoisting


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_typeof_operator">What is the `typeof` operator?</h3>

## **8. What is the `typeof` operator?**

The **`typeof` operator** in JavaScript is used to **check the data type** of a value or variable.
It returns the type as a **string**.

### ✅ **Examples**

```js
typeof "Hello"      // "string"
typeof 123          // "number"
typeof true         // "boolean"
typeof undefined    // "undefined"
typeof null         // "object"   // (JavaScript bug)
typeof {}           // "object"
typeof []           // "object"   // arrays are objects
typeof function(){} // "function"
```

---

## ✅ **Key Points**

* It tells you **what type of data** a variable contains.
* It always returns a **string** (e.g., `"string"`, `"number"`).
* `typeof null` returning `"object"` is an old **JavaScript bug**, but kept for compatibility.
* Arrays return `"object"` because they are special kinds of objects.

---

<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_are_primitive_and_non_primitive_values">What are primitive and non-primitive values?</h3>


## **9. What are primitive and non-primitive values?**

JavaScript values are divided into **primitive** and **non-primitive** types.

---

## ✅ **Primitive Values**

Primitive values are **simple**, **immutable**, and **stored directly** in memory.

### **Primitive types:**

1. **String**
2. **Number**
3. **Boolean**
4. **Undefined**
5. **Null**
6. **BigInt**
7. **Symbol**

### Example:

```js
let x = 10;
let y = x; 
x = 20;

// y is still 10 (copy of value)
```

Primitive values are **copied by value**.

---

## ✅ **Non-Primitive Values (Reference Types)**

These are **objects**. They are **mutable**, and stored by **reference**, not by value.

### Includes:

* **Object**
* **Array**
* **Function**
* **Date**, **RegExp**, **Map**, **Set**, etc.

### Example:

```js
let obj1 = { name: "John" };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj1.name = "Peter";

// obj2 also changes because both refer to the same object
```

Non-primitive values are **copied by reference**.

---

## 🚀 Summary Table

| Feature   | Primitive    | Non-Primitive                     |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Stored as | Value        | Reference                         |
| Mutable?  | No           | Yes                               |
| Copied as | Value copy   | Reference copy                    |
| Types     | 7 primitives | Objects (arrays, functions, etc.) |



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_nan">What is NaN?</h3>


## **10. What is `NaN`?**

**`NaN`** stands for **"Not-a-Number"**.
It is a special value in JavaScript that represents an **invalid number** or the result of a **failed numeric operation**.

---

## ✅ **When does `NaN` appear?**

### 1. Invalid mathematical operations

```js
0 / 0           // NaN
Math.sqrt(-1)   // NaN
```

### 2. Converting non-numeric strings to numbers

```js
Number("abc")   // NaN
parseInt("Hi")  // NaN
```

### 3. Arithmetic with undefined or invalid values

```js
undefined + 5   // NaN
```

---

## ✅ **Important properties of NaN**

### ❗ 1. `NaN` is of type **number**

```js
typeof NaN  // "number"
```

### ❗ 2. `NaN` is the **only value that is not equal to itself**

```js
NaN === NaN  // false
```

### ❗ 3. To check if a value is `NaN`, use:

```js
Number.isNaN(value)
```

---

## 🚀 Summary

* `NaN` = Not-a-Number.
* Appears when a numeric operation fails.
* Its type is `"number"`.
* It never equals itself.
* Use `Number.isNaN()` to check it safely.



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_strict_mode">What is strict mode?</h3>

## **12. What is Strict Mode (`"use strict"`) ?**

**Strict mode** is a feature in JavaScript that makes the code run in a **stricter**, more **secure**, and **error-sensitive** way.

You enable it by adding:

```js
"use strict";
```

at the top of a file or inside a function.

---

## ✅ **Why strict mode exists**

It helps:

* catch common coding mistakes
* prevent unsafe or buggy behaviors
* make JavaScript run more reliably

---

## ✅ **What strict mode does**

### 1. **Disallows using undeclared variables**

```js
"use strict";
x = 10; // ❌ Error: x is not defined
```

### 2. **Prevents duplicate parameter names**

```js
"use strict";
function test(a, a) {} // ❌ Error
```

### 3. **Makes `this` behave correctly**

In strict mode, `this` in a function that is not a method becomes **undefined** instead of the global object.

```js
"use strict";
function test() {
  console.log(this); // undefined
}
test();
```

### 4. **Prevents deleting variables or functions**

```js
"use strict";
let x = 5;
delete x; // ❌ Error
```

### 5. **Stops silent errors**

Some operations that would normally fail silently now throw real errors.

---

## 🚀 Summary

* `"use strict"` makes JavaScript behave more strictly and safely.
* Helps catch bugs earlier.
* Blocks bad syntax and unsafe actions.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_difference_between_value_and_reference_types">What is the difference between `value` and `reference` types?</h3>

## **Difference Between Value and Reference Types**

In JavaScript, data is stored in two ways: **value types** and **reference types**.

---

## ✅ **1. Value Types (Primitive Values)**

These include:

* Number
* String
* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
* Symbol
* BigInt

### ✔ Stored **directly** in memory

### ✔ Copied **by value**

Meaning a new, independent copy is created.

#### Example:

```js
let a = 10;
let b = a;  // b gets a COPY of a
a = 20;

console.log(b); // 10 (not affected)
```

---

## ✅ **2. Reference Types (Non-Primitive Values)**

These include:

* Object
* Array
* Function
* Date, Map, Set, etc.

### ✔ Stored as **references (pointers)**

### ✔ Copied **by reference**

Meaning both variables point to the **same memory location**.

#### Example:

```js
let obj1 = { name: "John" };
let obj2 = obj1;  // both refer to same object
obj1.name = "Peter";

console.log(obj2.name); // "Peter" (affected)
```

---

## 🚀 **Summary Table**

| Feature       | Value Types                   | Reference Types            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Stored as     | Actual value                  | Memory address (reference) |
| Copy behavior | Copy of value                 | Copy of reference          |
| Mutability    | Immutable                     | Mutable                    |
| Examples      | string, number, boolean, etc. | objects, arrays, functions |

<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_use_of_semicolons_in_javascript">What is the use of semicolons in JavaScript?</h3>

---

## **14. What is the use of semicolons in JavaScript?**

In JavaScript, **semicolons (`;`) are used to mark the end of a statement**.

Example:

```js
let x = 10;
console.log(x);
```

---

## ✅ **Why semicolons are used**

Semicolons:

1. **Separate statements**
2. **Prevent automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) errors**
3. Make your code **more predictable and cleaner**

---

## ⚠️ **JavaScript uses Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)**

JavaScript can automatically insert semicolons **when you omit them**.

Example (valid without semicolon):

```js
let x = 10
console.log(x)
```

But **ASI sometimes fails** and creates bugs.

---

## ❗ Example where missing semicolon breaks code

```js
let a = 5
let b = a
(10 + 20).toString()
```

JavaScript reads it as:

```js
let b = a(10 + 20).toString(); // ❌ Error
```

If you add semicolons:

```js
let a = 5;
let b = a;
(10 + 20).toString(); // ✔ Works
```

---

## 🚀 Summary

* Semicolons end statements.
* They avoid ASI-related bugs.
* JavaScript **can** work without them, but using semicolons is safer.

---

Ready for the next question!



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_difference_between_declaration_and_initialization">What is the difference between declaration and initialization?</h3>


## **15. What is the difference between declaration and initialization?**

### ✅ **1. Declaration**

Declaration means **creating a variable** (telling JavaScript it exists).

Example:

```js
let x;
```

The variable `x` is **declared** but not given a value.
Its value is automatically **undefined**.

---

### ✅ **2. Initialization (or assignment)**

Initialization means **giving a value** to the declared variable.

Example:

```js
x = 10;  // initialization (assigning value)
```

You can also declare and initialize at the same time:

```js
let y = 20;
```

---

## 🚀 **Summary Table**

| Action             | Meaning               | Example      |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Declaration**    | Creating the variable | `let a;`     |
| **Initialization** | Giving it a value     | `a = 5;`     |
| **Both together**  | Declare + initialize  | `let a = 5;` |


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_type_coercion">What is type coercion?</h3>

---

## **16. What is type coercion?**

**Type coercion** is the process where JavaScript **automatically converts one data type to another** when needed.

JavaScript does this because it is a **dynamically typed** and **loosely typed** language.

---

## ✅ **Two Types of Type Coercion**

### **1. Implicit Coercion (Automatic)**

JavaScript converts types **behind the scenes**.

Examples:

#### String coercion:

```js
"5" + 2   // "52"   (number → string)
```

#### Number coercion:

```js
"5" - 2   // 3     (string → number)
"10" * 2  // 20
```

#### Boolean coercion:

```js
if ("hello") { }  // "hello" becomes true
```

---

### **2. Explicit Coercion (Manual)**

You convert types **yourself** using functions.

Examples:

```js
Number("5")      // 5
String(123)      // "123"
Boolean(0)       // false
```

---

## 🚀 Summary

| Type                  | Meaning                           | Example           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Implicit Coercion** | JavaScript converts automatically | `"5" + 1 → "51"`  |
| **Explicit Coercion** | You convert manually              | `Number("5") → 5` |

Type coercion is how JavaScript decides the correct data type while performing operations.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_short_circuit_evaluation">What is short-circuit evaluation?</h3>

## **17. What is short-circuit evaluation?**

**Short-circuit evaluation** is a behavior in JavaScript where **logical operators** (`&&` and `||`) stop evaluating as soon as the final result is known.

---

## ✅ **1. AND operator (`&&`)**

In `A && B`:

* If **A is false**, JavaScript **does not check B**
* It returns the **first false value**

### Example:

```js
false && "Hello"   // false
0 && 5             // 0
```

### Only if A is true:

```js
true && "Hello"    // "Hello"
```

---

## ✅ **2. OR operator (`||`)**

In `A || B`:

* If **A is true**, JavaScript **does not check B**
* It returns the **first true value**

### Example:

```js
true || "Hello"   // true
"Hi" || 0         // "Hi"
```

### Only if A is false:

```js
0 || "Hello"      // "Hello"
```

---

## 🚀 **Why short-circuit evaluation is useful**

* To set **default values**

```js
let name = userName || "Guest";
```

* To check conditions safely

```js
user && user.profile && user.profile.name;
```

---

## **Summary**

| Operator | Stops When            | Returns          |                      |                 |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| `&&`     | First **false** value | That false value |                      |                 |
| `        |                       | `                | First **true** value | That true value |


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_difference_between_equale_and_object_is">What is the difference between `==` and `Object.is()`?</h3>

## **18. What is the difference between `==` and `Object.is()`?**

### **1. `==` (Loose Equality)**

`==` compares two values **after performing type coercion**.

✔ Converts types if needed
✔ Can produce unexpected results
✔ Easy to misuse

### Examples:

```js
5 == "5"        // true  (string → number)
0 == false      // true  (boolean → number)
null == undefined // true
```

---

## **2. `Object.is()`**

`Object.is()` checks **strict equality without type coercion**,
but with **more accurate handling** of special cases.

✔ No type conversion
✔ Correctly compares tricky values
✔ More precise than `===` in some cases

### Examples:

```js
Object.is(5, "5")      // false
Object.is(0, -0)       // false   (=== treats them as equal)
Object.is(NaN, NaN)    // true    (=== says false)
Object.is(true, true)  // true
```

---

## 🚀 **Key Differences**

| Feature         | `==`        | `Object.is()`           |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Type coercion?  | ✔ Yes       | ❌ No                    |
| NaN equals NaN? | ❌ No        | ✔ Yes                   |
| 0 equals -0?    | ✔ Yes       | ❌ No                    |
| Accuracy        | Low (loose) | Very high               |
| Best for        | Never use   | Checking exact equality |

---

## **Summary**

* `==` → loose equality (with type conversion)
* `Object.is()` → strict, accurate equality (even better than `===` in edge cases)

<h3 id="what_is_the_difference_between_mutable_and_immutable_data">What is the difference between mutable and immutable data?</h3>

## **20. What is the difference between mutable and immutable data?**

### ✅ **Immutable Data**

Immutable data **cannot be changed** after it is created.

When you modify it, JavaScript creates a **new value** instead of editing the original.

### Examples (Immutable):

* Number
* String
* Boolean
* Undefined
* Null
* Symbol
* BigInt

```js
let str = "Hello";
str[0] = "Y";   // ❌ does nothing
str = "Yellow"; // creates a NEW string
```

---

## **Mutable Data**

Mutable data **can be changed or updated** after creation.

These are **non-primitive** values (objects).

### Examples (Mutable):

* Object
* Array
* Function
* Map, Set, Date, etc.

```js
let user = { name: "John" };
user.name = "Peter";   // ✔ modifies the same object
```

---

## 🚀 **Summary Table**

| Feature        | Immutable                      | Mutable                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Can it change? | ❌ No                          | ✔ Yes                      |
| Stored as      | Value                          | Reference                  |
| Examples       | string, number, boolean, etc.  | objects, arrays, functions |
| Changing value | Creates a *new* variable/value | Modifies *existing* value  |

 <h3 id="what_is_an_arrow_function">  What is an arrow function? <h3>
 

**Answer:**
**Arrow functions** are a **shorter way** to write functions in JavaScript.
They were introduced in **ES6 (ES2015)** to make code simpler and cleaner.

---

### 📘 **Example — Normal Function vs Arrow Function**

**Regular function:**

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Arrow function:**

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

✅ Both do the same thing, but the arrow function is shorter and easier to read.

---

### ⚙️ **Rules & Features**

1. If there’s **only one line**, you can skip `{}` and `return`.

   ```js
   const greet = () => "Hello!";
   ```

2. If there’s **only one parameter**, you can skip the parentheses.

   ```js
   const square = x => x * x;
   ```

3. Arrow functions **don’t have their own `this`** —
   they **use `this` from the surrounding scope** (lexical `this`).

---

### ⚠️ **Example — `this` Difference:**

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi: () => console.log("Hi " + this.name)
};

person.sayHi(); // Output: "Hi undefined" ❌
```

Here, arrow functions don’t bind `this` to `person`;
they take it from the outer (global) scope.

---

### 🎯 **In short:**

> **Arrow functions** are **shorter and simpler** function syntax introduced in ES6,
> but they **don’t have their own `this`, `arguments`, or `prototype`.**

<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>



 <h3 id="what_is_a_function_expression">  What is a function expression? <h3>

 


A **function expression** is a function that is **assigned to a variable**, rather than declared with a name.

It is created at the time the code runs (runtime), not hoisted like a function declaration.

---

## ✅ **Example of a function expression**

```js
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
```

Here, the function is **anonymous** (has no name) and is assigned to `greet`.

You call it like this:

```js
greet();
```

---

## 🚀 **Key Characteristics of Function Expressions**

### ✔ **1. Not hoisted** like function declarations

You cannot use them before they are defined.

```js
sayHi();  // ❌ Error

const sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi");
};
```

---

### ✔ **2. Can be anonymous or named**

Anonymous:

```js
const a = function() {};
```

Named:

```js
const b = function myFunc() {};
```

---

### ✔ **3. Often used in callbacks**

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Done");
}, 1000);
```

---

## **Summary**

* A function expression is a function stored in a variable.
* It is not hoisted.
* It can be anonymous or named.
* Commonly used in callbacks.




<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>



 <h3 id="what_is_the_this_keyword">  What is the `this` keyword? <h3>
 

`this` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the **current execution context** — meaning **the object that is calling the function**.

Its value changes depending on **how** and **where** a function is called.

---

## ✅ **1. In an object method**

`this` refers to **the object**.

```js
const user = {
  name: "John",
  show() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

user.show(); // "John"
```

---

## ✅ **2. In a regular function (non-strict mode)**

`this` refers to the **global object** (`window` in browsers).

```js
function test() {
  console.log(this);
}

test(); // window
```

---

## ✅ **3. In strict mode**

`this` becomes **undefined** inside regular functions.

```js
"use strict";

function test() {
  console.log(this);
}

test(); // undefined
```

---

## ✅ **4. In event listeners**

`this` refers to the **DOM element** that received the event.

```js
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this); // the button element
});
```

---

## ✅ **5. In arrow functions**

Arrow functions **do not have their own `this`**.
They **inherit** `this` from the parent scope (lexical `this`).

```js
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  show: () => {
    console.log(this); // NOT obj → inherits from outer scope
  }
};

obj.show();
```

---

## **Summary**

`this` refers to **who is calling the function**:

| Situation                    | `this` refers to                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Method inside object         | The object                                  |
| Regular function             | Global object (or undefined in strict mode) |
| Arrow function               | Inherited parent `this`                     |
| Event listener               | The DOM element                             |
| Constructor function / class | New instance                                |

If you want, I can give real interview trick questions about `this`.

<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_a_closure">What is a closure?</h3>

## **27. What is a closure?**

A **closure** is a feature in JavaScript where an **inner function remembers and can access variables from its outer function**, even after the outer function has finished executing.

In simple words:

> A closure allows a function to **keep using** variables **outside its own scope**.

---

## ✅ **Example**

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;

  function inner() {
    console.log(count);   // inner can access count
  }

  return inner;
}

const fn = outer();
fn();  // 0
```

Even though `outer()` has finished running,
the inner function still **remembers** `count`.

---

## 🚀 Why closures are useful

* Private variables
* Function factories
* Module pattern
* Maintaining state without classes

### Example: Private variable

```js
function counter() {
  let num = 0;

  return function() {
    num++;
    return num;
  };
}

const c = counter();
c(); // 1
c(); // 2
c(); // 3
```

`num` stays private inside the closure.

---

## **Summary**

* Closure = inner function + lexical environment.
* Lets a function remember variables from its parent scope.
* Useful for private data and state management.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_lexical_scope">What is lexical scope?</h3>


## **28. What is lexical scope?**

**Lexical scope** (also called **static scope**) means that the **scope of a variable is determined by where it is written in the code**, not where it is called.

In simple terms:

> Variables are accessible based on their **physical location** in the source code.

---

## ✅ **How lexical scope works**

Inner functions can access:

* their own variables
* variables from their outer (parent) functions
* variables from the global scope

But outer functions **cannot** access variables inside inner functions.

---

## ✅ **Example**

```js
function outer() {
  let x = 10;

  function inner() {
    console.log(x);  // inner can access outer’s variable
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

Because `inner` is **written inside** `outer`, it has access to `outer`'s scope.

---

## 🚫 **Outer cannot access inner variables**

```js
function outer() {
  let x = 10;

  function inner() {
    let y = 20;
  }

  console.log(y); // ❌ Error: y is not defined
}
```

---

## 🚀 **Summary**

* Lexical scope is determined by **code structure**, not function calls.
* Inner functions can access outer variables.
* Outer functions cannot access inner variables.
* Lexical scope enables **closures**.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_an_iife">What is an IIFE?</h3>


## **29. What is an IIFE?**

An **IIFE** stands for **Immediately Invoked Function Expression**.

It is a function that is:

1. **Defined**, and
2. **Executed immediately** (without being called later)

---

## ✅ **Basic syntax**

```js
(function () {
  console.log("IIFE running!");
})();
```

* The function is wrapped in parentheses → makes it an **expression**, not a declaration.
* The final `()` immediately **executes** it.

---

## ✅ **Why use an IIFE?**

### ✔ 1. To avoid polluting the global scope

Variables inside an IIFE stay **private**.

```js
(function () {
  let secret = "hidden";
})();
console.log(secret); // ❌ Error
```

### ✔ 2. To create private variables and modules

### ✔ 3. To run setup code immediately

### ✔ 4. Commonly used before ES6 modules existed

---

## ✔ Example with parameters

```js
(function (name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
})("John");
```

---

## **Summary**

* IIFE = function executed right after it is created.
* Keeps variables private.
* Prevents global scope pollution.
* Often used for initialization code.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>



<h3 id="what_is_recursion">What is recursion?</h3>


**Recursion** is a technique where a function **calls itself** to solve a problem.

A recursive function must have:

1. **Base case** → stops the recursion
2. **Recursive case** → the function calling itself again with a smaller/simpler input

---

### **Example**

```js
function countdown(n) {
  if (n === 0) return;   // base case
  console.log(n);
  countdown(n - 1);      // recursive call
}
```

---

### **In simple words**

Recursion is when a function solves a problem by breaking it into smaller versions of itself until it reaches a stopping point.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>



<h3 id="what_are_callbacks">What are callbacks?</h3>


A **callback** is a function that is **passed as an argument to another function** and is executed **later**.

In simple words:
**A callback is a function you give to another function so it can call it back when it's ready.**

---

## ✅ Example

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback();
}

greet("John", function () {
  console.log("Welcome!");
});
```

---

## ✔ Why callbacks are used?

* To handle **asynchronous operations** (like API calls, timers, reading files)
* To execute code **after** something else completes
* To customize function behavior

---

## 🕒 Asynchronous callback example

```js
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This runs later");
}, 1000);
```

---

## Summary

* A callback is a function passed to another function.
* It runs after the first function finishes or when an event occurs.
* Common in asynchronous JavaScript.

Want the next one?



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_are_highe_order_functions">What are higher-order functions?</h3>


A **higher-order function (HOF)** is a function that does **at least one** of the following:

1. **Takes another function as an argument**, OR
2. **Returns a function**

If a function does either of those, it is a higher-order function.

---

## ✅ Example: Taking a function as an argument

```js
function repeat(n, callback) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    callback();
  }
}

repeat(3, () => console.log("Hello"));
```

---

## ✅ Example: Returning a function

```js
function multiplyBy(n) {
  return function (x) {
    return x * n;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

---

## ✔ Common higher-order functions in JavaScript

* `map()`
* `filter()`
* `reduce()`
* `forEach()`
* `setTimeout()`
* Event listeners

---

## **Summary**

A higher-order function is any function that **accepts a function**, **returns a function**, or **does both**.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_currying">What is currying?</h3>

**Currying** is a technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into **a series of functions**, each taking **one argument at a time**.

Instead of:

```js
func(a, b, c)
```

Currying makes it:

```js
func(a)(b)(c)
```

---

## ✅ Example of a curried function

```js
function curryAdd(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(curryAdd(1)(2)(3)); // 6
```

---

## ✅ Why use currying?

* Reuse functions with preset values (partial application)
* More flexibility in function composition
* Cleaner functional programming style

---

## ✔ Example: Partial application

```js
function multiply(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a * b;
  };
}

const double = multiply(2);
console.log(double(10)); // 20
```

---

## **Summary**

Currying breaks a multi-argument function into a chain of single-argument functions, allowing more reusable and flexible functional code.



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_memoization">What is memoization?</h3>

**Memoization** is an optimization technique where a function **stores the results** of expensive calculations and **reuses** them when the same inputs occur again.

In simple words:
**Memoization = caching function results.**

---

## ✅ Example: Without memoization

```js
function slowSquare(n) {
  console.log("Calculating...");
  return n * n;
}

slowSquare(5); // Calculating... → 25
slowSquare(5); // Calculating... → 25  (repeated work!)
```

---

## ✅ Example: With memoization

```js
function memoizedSquare() {
  const cache = {};

  return function (n) {
    if (cache[n]) {
      return cache[n];  // return from cache
    }
    console.log("Calculating...");
    cache[n] = n * n;    // store in cache
    return cache[n];
  };
}

const square = memoizedSquare();

console.log(square(5)); // Calculating... → 25
console.log(square(5)); // 25 (from cache, fast!)
```

---

## ✔ Why use memoization?

* Avoid repeating heavy computations
* Improve performance
* Useful in recursion (like Fibonacci)
* Used in React (e.g., `useMemo`, `useCallback`)

---

## **Summary**

Memoization improves performance by **storing previous results** and returning them immediately when the same inputs appear again.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>



<h3 id="what_are_the_differences_between_call_apply_and_bind">What are the differences between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`?</h3>

All three are used to **set the value of `this`** in a function, but they differ in **how arguments are passed** and **when the function runs**.

---

# ✅ **1. `call()`**

### **Calls the function immediately**

Arguments are passed **individually**.

**Syntax:**

```js
func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)
```

**Example:**

```js
function greet(a, b) {
  console.log(this.name, a, b);
}

greet.call({ name: "John" }, "Hello", "World");
```

---

# ✅ **2. `apply()`**

### **Calls the function immediately**

Arguments are passed **as an array**.

**Syntax:**

```js
func.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...])
```

**Example:**

```js
greet.apply({ name: "John" }, ["Hello", "World"]);
```

---

# ✅ **3. `bind()`**

### **Does NOT call the function immediately**

It returns a **new function** with `this` permanently set.

**Syntax:**

```js
const newFunc = func.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)
```

**Example:**

```js
const newGreet = greet.bind({ name: "John" }, "Hello");
newGreet("World"); // runs later
```

---

# ⭐ Summary Table

| Method      | Calls Immediately? | Arguments Format | Returns New Function? |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **call()**  | ✔ Yes              | Individual args  | ✘ No                  |
| **apply()** | ✔ Yes              | Array of args    | ✘ No                  |
| **bind()**  | ✘ No               | Individual args  | ✔ Yes                 |

---

If you want, I can show real-world use cases (event handlers, borrowing methods, constructors).


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>



<h3 id="what_is_debouncing">What is debouncing?</h3>

**Debouncing means:
A function will run only after the user stops doing something for some time.**

---

## ⭐ Example

If a user is typing in a search box:

* They type "g" → wait
* They type "go" → wait
* They type "gop" → wait
* They stop typing → **now run the function**

So the function runs **only once** after typing stops.

---

## ⭐ Why we use debouncing?

* To avoid calling API many times
* To reduce unnecessary work
* To make the website faster

---

## ⭐ Very Simple Code Example

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;

  return function () {
    clearTimeout(timer);

    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func();
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

Usage:

```javascript
const search = debounce(() => {
  console.log("Search API call");
}, 500);
```

If user types fast, the function runs **only after 500ms** of no typing.




<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_throttling">What is throttling?</h3>


**Throttling means:
A function will run only one time in a fixed time gap.
Even if you call it many times.**

---

## ⭐ Example

You scroll a page → browser gives many scroll events (maybe 100 times in 1 second).
But with throttling, your function runs **only once every 300ms**.

---

## ⭐ Why we use throttling?

* To stop a function from running too many times
* To make website fast
* To reduce load on browser or API

---

## ⭐ Very Simple Example Code

```javascript
function throttle(func, delay) {
  let run = true;

  return function () {
    if (run) {
      func();
      run = false;

      setTimeout(() => {
        run = true;
      }, delay);
    }
  };
}
```

Usage:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("scroll", throttle(() => {
  console.log("Scrolling...");
}, 500));
```

Even if user scrolls 100 times, your message prints **only once in 500ms**.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_event_loop">What is the event loop?</h3>

The **event loop** is the mechanism that allows JavaScript (which is single-threaded) to handle **asynchronous** operations without blocking the main thread.

It continuously checks:

1. **Call stack** (what is currently running)
2. **Callback/task queues** (what should run next)
3. Moves tasks from the queues → stack when the stack is empty

This makes JavaScript appear fast and non-blocking.

---

## ✔ Simple explanation

JavaScript can do one thing at a time (single-threaded).
But async tasks like **setTimeout**, **Promises**, and **fetch** run in the background (browser/web APIs).
When they're done, the event loop pushes their callbacks back into the call stack **when it's free**.

---

## ✔ Diagram (simple)

```
Call Stack  ←----------- push callbacks -----------  Task Queue
       ↑                                             (micro + macro)
       |                                                    ↑
       -------------- Event Loop ---------------------------
```

---

## ✔ Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside timeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

### Output:

```
Start
End
Inside timeout
```

Even with `0 ms`, the timeout runs later because the event loop waits for the call stack to empty.

---

## ✔ Microtasks vs Macrotasks

* **Microtasks (higher priority)**

  * Promises (`.then`)
  * MutationObserver
  * queueMicrotask()

* **Macrotasks**

  * setTimeout
  * setInterval
  * DOM events
  * setImmediate (Node)

Event loop first clears **microtasks**, then **macrotasks**.

---

## **Summary**

The event loop:

* Checks if the call stack is empty
* Moves callbacks from queues into the stack
* Allows JavaScript to run asynchronous code efficiently

Ready for the next one!


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_the_call_stack">What is the call stack?</h3>

The **call stack** is a data structure used by JavaScript to keep track of **which function is currently running** and **what function to return to next**.

It works in a **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) order.

---

## ✅ How the call stack works

* When a function is **called**, it is **pushed** onto the stack.
* When the function **finishes**, it is **popped** off the stack.
* JavaScript can run **only one function at a time** because it has a single call stack → single-threaded.

---

## ✔ Example

```js
function a() {
  b();
}

function b() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

a();
```

### Call stack steps:

1. `a()` pushed
2. inside `a()`, call `b()` → `b()` pushed
3. `b()` prints → popped
4. `a()` finishes → popped

Stack becomes empty again.

---

## ✔ Visual representation

```
| b() |
| a() |
-------
(call stack)
```

After finishing:

```
(empty)
```

---

## ✔ Key points

* Single-threaded → one function at a time
* Functions are pushed/popped as they run
* If a function never ends → **stack overflow**
* Works together with **event loop** for async tasks

---

## **Summary**

The call stack is the part of the JavaScript engine that tracks function execution in a last-in-first-out order.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_are_microtasks_and_macrotasks">What are microtasks and macrotasks?</h3>

In JavaScript’s event loop, asynchronous operations are divided into **two types of queues**:

1. **Microtasks** → highest priority
2. **Macrotasks** → lower priority

Microtasks always run **before** macrotasks.

---

# ✅ **Microtasks**

These are *small, fast tasks* that should run **immediately after the current code finishes**, *before* any rendering or other tasks.

### **Examples of microtasks**

* **Promises** (`.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`)
* **queueMicrotask()**
* **MutationObserver**
* Node.js: `process.nextTick()`

### **Executed when?**

After the current call stack is empty, **all microtasks** are executed **before any macrotask**.

---

# ✅ **Macrotasks**

These are *larger asynchronous tasks* that go into the macrotask queue.

### **Examples of macrotasks**

* `setTimeout`
* `setInterval`
* `setImmediate` (Node.js)
* DOM events (click, scroll)
* Network requests (`fetch`, XHR callback)
* I/O operations

### **Execution pattern**

The event loop runs:

1. One macrotask
2. Then **all microtasks**
3. Then the next macrotask
4. Repeat…

---

# ✔ Example (important!)

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise");
});

console.log("End");
```

### **Output**

```
Start
End
Promise   ← microtask (runs first)
Timeout   ← macrotask (runs later)
```

Even with `0 ms`, `setTimeout` waits because **microtasks always have priority**.

<h3 id="what_are_objects_in_javascript" >What are objects in JavaScript? <h3>


Objects in JavaScript are **collections of key–value pairs** used to store structured data and behavior.

* Keys → also called **properties**
* Values → can be **any type** (string, number, boolean, array, function, even another object)

JavaScript objects are dynamic — you can add, update, or remove properties at any time.

---

## ✅ **Example (object literal)**

```js
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isActive: true
};
```

---

## ✅ Objects can store functions (methods)

```js
const user = {
  name: "John",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello " + this.name);
  }
};

user.greet();
```

---

## **Summary**

An object is a flexible data structure that stores related data and functions as key–value pairs.

<h3 id="how_can_you_create_objects_in_javascript" >How can you create objects in JavaScript? <h3>



JavaScript gives you **several ways** to create objects.
Here are the **main methods** 👇

---

### 🧩 **1. Object Literal (Most Common & Simple)**

You create an object directly using `{}`.

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

console.log(person.name); // John
person.greet();           // Hello!
```

✅ **Use when:** you just need one or a few objects quickly.

---

### 🧩 **2. Using the `new Object()` Constructor**

This uses JavaScript’s built-in `Object` constructor.

```js
const person = new Object();
person.name = "John";
person.age = 25;
```

✅ **Same as literal**, just longer — rarely used today.

---

### 🧩 **3. Using a Constructor Function**

You define a **function** that acts as a **blueprint** for objects,
and use the `new` keyword to create instances.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const person1 = new Person("John", 25);
console.log(person1.name); // John
```

✅ **Use when:** you want to create **many similar objects**.

---

### 🧩 **4. Using `Object.create()`**

You create a new object and set its **prototype** manually.

```js
const animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    console.log("Animal walks");
  }
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.barks = true;

console.log(dog.eats); // true (inherited from animal)
```

✅ **Use when:** you want to **inherit** directly from another object.

---

### 🧩 **5. Using ES6 `class` Syntax**

Modern and cleaner syntax — works like constructor functions but easier to read.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const p1 = new Person("John", 25);
p1.greet(); // Hi, I'm John
```

✅ **Use when:** you want **object-oriented style** code (recommended for large apps).

---

| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Object Literal**       | `{ name: "John" }`     | Simple, one-time objects               |

| **Constructor Function** | `new Person()`         | Create many similar objects            |
| **`Object.create()`**    | `Object.create(proto)` | Create objects with a custom prototype |
| **Class**                | `new Person()`         | Modern OOP style creation              |

<h3 id="difference_between_dot_notation_and_bracket_notation" >Difference between dot notation and bracket notation? <h3>


JavaScript provides **two ways** to access object properties:

---

# ✅ **1. Dot Notation (`.`)**

**Simplest and most common** way to access properties.

### ✔ Usage:

```js
object.property
```

### ✔ Example:

```js
const user = { name: "John" };
console.log(user.name); // "John"
```

### ✔ When to use:

* When the property name is a **valid identifier** (letters, numbers, $, _)
* When the property name is **known in advance**

---

# ✅ **2. Bracket Notation (`[]`)**

Allows accessing properties **using strings or variables**.

### ✔ Usage:

```js
object["property"]
```

### ✔ Example:

```js
const user = { name: "John" };
console.log(user["name"]); // "John"
```

### ✔ Supports dynamic keys:

```js
const key = "age";
const user = { age: 30 };

console.log(user[key]); // 30
```

### ✔ Allows keys with spaces or special characters:

```js
const obj = { "first name": "John" };

console.log(obj["first name"]); // valid
// obj.first name // ❌ invalid
```

---

# ⭐ **Summary Table**

| Feature                    | Dot Notation | Bracket Notation   |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Easy to read               | ✔ Yes        | ✔ Yes (but longer) |
| Dynamic keys               | ❌ No         | ✔ Yes              |
| Keys with spaces           | ❌ No         | ✔ Yes              |
| Keys starting with numbers | ❌ No         | ✔ Yes              |
| Requires a string          | ❌ No         | ✔ Yes              |



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_prototypal_inheritance" >What is prototypal inheritance? <h3>



**Prototypal inheritance** is JavaScript’s system where **objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects** through a hidden internal link called `[[Prototype]]`.

In simple words:
**Objects can use features of other objects by referencing them as their prototype.**

---

## ✅ **Key idea**

Every JavaScript object has a **prototype**, which is another object.
If you try to access a property and it doesn’t exist on the object, JavaScript looks for it **up the prototype chain**.

---

## ✔ Example

```js
const parent = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

const child = Object.create(parent);

child.greet(); // inherited from parent
```

`child` doesn’t have `greet()`, so it looks at its prototype (`parent`).

---

## ✔ Prototype chain

```
child → parent → Object.prototype → null
```

JavaScript walks upward until it finds the property or reaches `null`.

---

## ✔ Where prototypes are used

* Objects created using `Object.create()`
* Constructor functions
* ES6 classes (`class`) — they use prototypes behind the scenes

---

## **Summary**

Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties from other objects through a prototype chain, making JavaScript flexible and efficient.



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>

<h3 id="what_is_the_prototype_chain" >What is the prototype chain? <h3>


The **prototype chain** is the mechanism JavaScript uses to **look up properties and methods** when they are not found on the current object.

When you access a property:

1. JavaScript checks the object itself.
2. If not found, it looks at the object’s **prototype**.
3. Then the prototype’s prototype.
4. And so on…
5. Until it reaches `null`.

This linked list of prototypes is called the **prototype chain**.

---

## ✅ **Example**

```js
const parent = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};

const child = Object.create(parent);

child.greet(); // Found in parent
```

Lookup steps:

* Does `child` have `greet()`? ❌ No
* Check `child.__proto__` → parent ✔ Yes
* Execute it

---

## ✔ Prototype chain structure

Typical chain looks like:

```
child
  ↓ [[Prototype]]
parent
  ↓ [[Prototype]]
Object.prototype
  ↓ [[Prototype]]
null
```

---

## ✔ Important points

* All objects eventually inherit from **Object.prototype**.
* The chain ends at **null**.
* If a property isn’t found anywhere in the chain → result is `undefined`.

---

## **Summary**

The prototype chain is the path JavaScript follows to find properties by checking the object and then climbing up through its prototypes until it reaches `null`.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_a_constructor_function" >What is a constructor function? <h3>

A **constructor function** is a special kind of function used to create **multiple objects with the same structure and behavior**.

It acts like a **template** for creating objects.

By convention, constructor function names start with a **capital letter**.

---

## ✅ **Example**

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const p1 = new Person("John", 25);
const p2 = new Person("Alice", 30);
```

Here:

* `Person` is the constructor function
* `new Person()` creates a **new object**
* `this` refers to the new object
* Properties (`name`, `age`) are assigned to that object

---

## ✔ What happens behind the scenes when using `new`?

Calling `new Person()` does:

1. Creates a new empty object: `{}`
2. Sets its prototype → `Person.prototype`
3. Binds `this` inside the function to that new object
4. Returns the new object automatically

---

## ✔ Adding shared methods using prototype

```js
Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello " + this.name);
};

p1.greet();
```

Using `prototype` ensures all objects share the same method (memory efficient).

---

## **Summary**

A constructor function is a blueprint used with the `new` keyword to create multiple similar objects, with shared behavior via `prototype`.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_are_es6_classes" >What are ES6 classes? <h3>


**ES6 classes** are a modern, cleaner syntax introduced in ES6 (2015) for creating objects and handling inheritance in JavaScript.

They are **not new object systems** —
they are just **syntax sugar** on top of JavaScript’s existing **prototype-based** inheritance.

Classes make code more readable and easier to structure.

---

## ✅ **Basic class example**

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log("Hello " + this.name);
  }
}

const p1 = new Person("John", 25);
p1.greet(); // Hello John
```

---

## ✔ Key features of ES6 classes

### **1. `constructor` method**

Runs automatically when a new instance is created.

### **2. Methods inside classes**

Automatically added to the prototype.

### **3. No commas between methods**

### **4. Inheritance using `extends`**

```js
class Student extends Person {
  study() {
    console.log(this.name + " is studying");
  }
}
```

### **5. `super()` keyword**

Used to call the parent class constructor.

---

## 🆚 **Classes vs Constructor Functions**

| ES6 Classes                              | Constructor Functions               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Cleaner syntax                           | More verbose                        |
| Built-in inheritance using `extends`     | Manual prototype manipulation       |
| Methods automatically added to prototype | Must assign to `Function.prototype` |
| Looks like OOP languages                 | Prototype-based style               |

---

## **Summary**

ES6 classes are a modern, readable syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance in JavaScript. They still use prototypes internally but make object-oriented programming much easier.

---

<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="what_is_object_create" >What is `Object.create()`? <h3>


`Object.create()` is a method used to **create a new object** and **directly set its prototype**.

In simple words:
**It creates an object that inherits from another object.**

---

## ✅ **Basic example**

```js
const parent = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};

const child = Object.create(parent);

child.greet(); // inherited from parent
```

Here:

* `parent` → becomes the prototype of `child`
* `child` inherits all properties and methods from `parent`

---

## ✔ Why use `Object.create()`?

### **1. Direct control of the prototype**

You can set the prototype without constructor functions or classes.

### **2. Clean inheritance**

No need for `function` or `class`.

### **3. Create objects with shared behavior**

Efficient and simple.

---

## ✔ Creating an object with custom properties

```js
const person = Object.create(
  {
    greet() {
      console.log("Hi!");
    }
  },
  {
    name: { value: "John", writable: true }
  }
);

console.log(person.name); // John
person.greet();
```

---

## ✔ Prototype chain visualization

```
child → parent → Object.prototype → null
```

---

## **Summary**

`Object.create()` creates a new object with the prototype you specify, making it a simple and powerful tool for prototypal inheritance.

<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>


<h3 id="difference_between_object_freeze_and_object_seal" >Difference between `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`? <h3>

Both are used to **restrict changes** to an object, but the level of restriction is different.

---

# ✅ **1. `Object.freeze()` — MOST strict**

**You cannot:**

* ❌ Add new properties
* ❌ Remove properties
* ❌ Modify existing properties
* ❌ Reassign values

The object becomes **fully immutable**.

### Example:

```js
const obj = { a: 1 };

Object.freeze(obj);

obj.a = 100;   // ❌ ignored
obj.b = 2;     // ❌ ignored
delete obj.a;  // ❌ ignored

console.log(obj); // { a: 1 }
```

---

# ✅ **2. `Object.seal()` — PARTIALLY strict**

**You cannot:**

* ❌ Add new properties
* ❌ Remove properties

**But you can still:**

* ✔ Modify existing property values (if writable)

### Example:

```js
const obj = { a: 1 };

Object.seal(obj);

obj.a = 100;   // ✔ allowed
obj.b = 2;     // ❌ not allowed
delete obj.a;  // ❌ not allowed

console.log(obj); // { a: 100 }
```

---

# ⭐ Summary Table

| Feature               | `Object.freeze()` | `Object.seal()`       |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Add properties        | ❌ No              | ❌ No                  |
| Delete properties     | ❌ No              | ❌ No                  |
| Modify values         | ❌ No              | ✔ Yes                 |
| Make object immutable | ✔ Fully immutable | ❌ Partially immutable |

---

## **Summary**

* `freeze()` → **No add, no delete, no changes**
* `seal()` → **No add, no delete, BUT can change values**

<h3 id="what_is_the_difference_between_shallow_and_deep_copy" >What is the difference between shallow and deep copy? <h3>


### **1. Shallow Copy**

A **shallow copy** copies only the **top-level properties**.

If the object contains nested objects or arrays, **only their references are copied**, not the actual values.

➡️ So changing a nested object affects both the original and the copy.

### Example:

```js
const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };

const shallow = { ...original }; // or Object.assign({}, original)

shallow.b.c = 999;

console.log(original.b.c); // 999 ❗ (affected)
```

---

## ✅ **2. Deep Copy**

A **deep copy** copies **all levels**, including nested objects, arrays, and references.

➡️ The original and the copy become **completely independent**.

### Example:

```js
const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };

const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));

deep.b.c = 999;

console.log(original.b.c); // 2 🎉 (not affected)
```

---

## ⭐ Summary Table

| Feature                                 | Shallow Copy | Deep Copy |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Copies top-level values                 | ✔ Yes        | ✔ Yes     |
| Copies nested objects independently     | ❌ No         | ✔ Yes     |
| Nested objects share references         | ✔ Yes        | ❌ No      |
| Changing nested values affects original | ✔ Yes        | ❌ No      |

---

## Examples of Shallow Copy

* Spread operator `...`
* `Object.assign()`
* `Array.prototype.slice()`
* `Array.from()`

## Examples of Deep Copy

* `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` (simple data only)
* `structuredClone(obj)` (best modern method)
* Manual recursive copy function

---

If you'd like, I can explain with diagrams or real-world analogies!



<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>

<h3 id="how_do_you_clone_an_object" >How do you clone an object? <h3>


Cloning an object means creating a **copy** of it.
There are **two types** of cloning:

* **Shallow clone**
* **Deep clone**

Below are the most commonly used methods.

---

# ✅ **1. Shallow Clone Methods**

### **a) Spread operator (most common)**

```js
const copy = { ...original };
```

### **b) Object.assign()**

```js
const copy = Object.assign({}, original);
```

### **c) Shallow clone of arrays**

```js
const copyArr = [...arr];
```

➡️ These methods **do NOT clone nested objects** (nested objects share references).

---

# ✅ **2. Deep Clone Methods**

(Clones nested objects too)

### **a) structuredClone() (BEST & modern)**

```js
const deepCopy = structuredClone(original);
```

Supports objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, etc.

### **b) JSON method (simple but limited)**

```js
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
```

❌ Does not support `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `undefined`, functions, circular references.

### **c) Manual deep clone (recursive)**

```js
function deepClone(obj) {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== "object") return obj;

  const copy = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};

  for (let key in obj) {
    copy[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
  }

  return copy;
}
```

---

# ✅ Summary Table

| Method                         | Type    | Supports nested? | Notes              |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `{ ...obj }`                   | Shallow | ❌               | Fast, common       |
| `Object.assign()`              | Shallow | ❌               | Same as spread     |
| `structuredClone()`            | Deep    | ✔                | Best modern method |
| `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` | Deep    | ✔                | Limited data types |
| `Recursive function`           | Deep    | ✔                | Custom control     |

<h3 id="what_is_destructuring" >What is destructuring? <h3>


**Destructuring assignment** is a feature in JavaScript that lets you **unpack (extract) values** from **arrays or objects** into separate variables easily.

It makes code **shorter and easier to read**.

---

### 📘 **1. Array Destructuring**

You can extract values from an array:

```js
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

const [first, second, third] = colors;

console.log(first);  // red
console.log(second); // green
console.log(third);  // blue
```

You can also skip values:

```js
const [a, , c] = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a, c); // 1 3
```

---

### 📦 **2. Object Destructuring**

You can extract properties from an object:

```js
const person = { name: "John", age: 25, city: "New York" };

const { name, age } = person;

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age);  // 25
```

You can also rename variables:

```js
const { name: userName, city: userCity } = person;
console.log(userName); // John
console.log(userCity); // New York
```

---

### ⚙️ **3. Default Values**

You can set default values when the property doesn’t exist:

```js
const { country = "USA" } = person;
console.log(country); // USA
```

---

### 🎯 **In short:**

> **Destructuring** lets you **quickly extract values** from arrays or objects
> and store them in variables — making your code cleaner and shorter.


<span style="color:green;">================================================================ </span>



<h3 id="what_are_spread_and_rest_operators_in_javascript" >What are Spread and Rest Operators in JavaScript? <h3>



Both the **spread (`...`)** and **rest (`...`)** operators use **three dots**,
but they work in **opposite ways** depending on where they’re used.

---

### 🌀 **1. Spread Operator (`...`)**

➡️ **Used to expand (spread out)** elements from arrays or objects.

It takes items **out of** an array or object.

**Example (Array):**

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const moreNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5];

console.log(moreNumbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Example (Object):**

```js
const person = { name: "John", age: 25 };
const updatedPerson = { ...person, city: "New York" };

console.log(updatedPerson);
// { name: "John", age: 25, city: "New York" }
```

✅ It’s great for **copying** or **combining** arrays and objects.

---

### 🧩 **2. Rest Operator (`...`)**

➡️ **Used to collect (gather)** multiple values into a single variable.

It takes items **into** an array.

**Example (Function Parameters):**

```js
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 10
```

**Example (Destructuring):**

```js
const [first, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(first); // 10
console.log(rest);  // [20, 30, 40]
```

---

### ⚙️ **Main Difference:**

| Operator           | Meaning         | Direction | Example Use            |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| **Spread (`...`)** | Expands values  | Outward   | Combine arrays/objects |
| **Rest (`...`)**   | Collects values | Inward    | Gather function args   |

---

### 🎯 **In short:**

> **Spread (`...`)** expands values out of arrays/objects.
> **Rest (`...`)** gathers multiple values into an array.

| Feature                  | `slice()`                            | `splice()`                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Modifies original array? | ❌ No                                 | ✔ Yes                                 |
| Returns what?            | A **new array**                      | The **removed elements**              |
| Purpose                  | To **copy/extract** part of an array | To **add or remove** elements         |
| Arguments                | `(start, end)`                       | `(start, deleteCount, ...itemsToAdd)` |

---

# ✅ **1. `slice()` — Non-destructive (does NOT change original)**

Used to **copy** or **extract** a part of an array.

### Example:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const result = arr.slice(1, 3);

console.log(result); // [2, 3]
console.log(arr);    // [1, 2, 3, 4] (unchanged)
```

---

# ✅ **2. `splice()` — Destructive (MODIFIES original array)**

Used to **add**, **remove**, or **replace** elements in an array.

### Example: remove elements

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const removed = arr.splice(1, 2);

console.log(removed); // [2, 3]
console.log(arr);     // [1, 4] (changed)
```

### Example: add elements

```js
const arr = [1, 4];
arr.splice(1, 0, 2, 3);

console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

# ⭐ **Summary (Easy to remember)**

* **slice = safe** → does NOT modify
* **splice = surgery** → modifies the array

<h3 id="what_is_the_difference_between_methods"> What is the difference between `map()`, `forEach()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`?</h3>



### 🧩 1. **`forEach()`**

👉 Used to **loop through** each element in an array.
It **does not return** anything — just performs an action.

**Example:**

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2));
```

🟢 Output:

```
2
4
6
```

✅ **Use when:** you just want to **run code for each item** (like printing or updating).

---

### 🧩 2. **`map()`**

👉 Creates a **new array** by **transforming** each element.
The **length stays the same**, but the **values can change**.

**Example:**

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

🟢 Output:

```
[2, 4, 6]
```

✅ **Use when:** you want a **new array** with **modified values**.

---

### 🧩 3. **`filter()`**

👉 Creates a **new array** with elements that **meet a condition**.
It **filters out** the ones that don’t match.

**Example:**

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let even = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(even);
```

🟢 Output:

```
[2, 4]
```

✅ **Use when:** you want to **keep only some elements** based on a test.

---

### 🧩 4. **`reduce()`**

👉 Reduces an array to **a single value** (like sum, average, or object).
You provide a **callback** and an **initial value**.

**Example:**

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let total = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(total);
```

🟢 Output:

```
10
```

✅ **Use when:** you want to **combine all elements** into **one result**.

---

### 🧠 **Quick Summary Table**

| Method        | Returns New Array? | Purpose                | Example Result   |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| **forEach()** | ❌ No               | Loop through items     | Just prints/logs |
| **map()**     | ✅ Yes              | Transform each item    | `[2,4,6]`        |
| **filter()**  | ✅ Yes              | Select some items      | `[2,4]`          |
| **reduce()**  | ❌ (any value)      | Combine into one value | `10`             |

---

### 🎯 **Simple Summary:**

> * `forEach()` → just loop
> * `map()` → transform values
> * `filter()` → keep what you need
> * `reduce()` → make one final result

<h3 id="how_do_you_remove_duplicates_from_an_array" >How do you remove duplicates from an array? <h3>

There are several common ways.
The **most modern and simplest** is using a **Set**.

---

## **1. Using Set (BEST & easiest)**

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4];

const unique = [...new Set(arr)];

console.log(unique); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

## **2. Using `filter()` + `indexOf()`**

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4];

const unique = arr.filter((item, index) => arr.indexOf(item) === index);

console.log(unique);
```

---

## **3. Using `reduce()`**

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3];

const unique = arr.reduce((acc, val) => {
  if (!acc.includes(val)) acc.push(val);
  return acc;
}, []);

console.log(unique);
```

---

## **4. Using an object or Map (fast for large data)**

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3];

const map = {};
const result = [];

arr.forEach(item => {
  if (!map[item]) {
    map[item] = true;
    result.push(item);
  }
});

console.log(result);
```

---

# ⭐ Summary

| Method       | Best For         | Notes               |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `new Set()`  | Most cases       | Fast, clean, modern |
| `filter()`   | Simple logic     | Slightly slower     |
| `reduce()`   | Functional style | Good for interviews |
| `Map/Object` | Large datasets   | Very fast           |

<h3 id="how_do_you_sort_an_array_of_objects"> How do you sort an array of objects? <h3>


You sort an array of objects using **`Array.prototype.sort()`** with a **custom compare function**.

---

##  Example 1: Sort by a number property

```js
const users = [
  { name: "A", age: 30 },
  { name: "B", age: 20 },
  { name: "C", age: 25 }
];

users.sort((a, b) => a.age - b.age);

console.log(users);
// Sorted by age: 20, 25, 30
```

### Explanation:

* `a.age - b.age`

  * negative → a comes first
  * positive → b comes first
  * zero → equal (no change)

---

# ✅ Example 2: Sort by a string property

Use `localeCompare()`.

```js
const items = [
  { name: "banana" },
  { name: "apple" },
  { name: "cherry" }
];

items.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));

console.log(items);
```

---

# ✅ Example 3: Sort descending

```js
users.sort((a, b) => b.age - a.age);
```

---

# ✅ Example 4: Sort by multiple fields

First by `age`, then by `name`:

```js
users.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.age !== b.age) return a.age - b.age;
  return a.name.localeCompare(b.name);
});
```

---

# ⭐ Summary

* Use **`.sort()`** with a compare function.
* Numbers → `a.prop - b.prop`
* Strings → `a.prop.localeCompare(b.prop)`
* Multiple fields → check one, then fallback to another.

Here’s the answer **clean, simple, and interview-ready**:

---

# ✅ What is array flattening?

**Array flattening** means converting a **nested (multi-dimensional) array** into a **single-level array**.

Example of a nested array:

```js
[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]]
```

Flattened:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

---

# ✅ 1. `flat()` (ES2019 — BEST & simplest)

### **Shallow flatten (one level)**

```js
const arr = [1, [2, 3]];
const flat = arr.flat();
console.log(flat); // [1, 2, 3]
```

### **Deep flatten**

```js
const arr = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];
const flat = arr.flat(Infinity);

console.log(flat); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

# ✅ 2. Using `reduce()` + recursion

```js
function flatten(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((acc, val) => {
    return Array.isArray(val) 
      ? acc.concat(flatten(val))
      : acc.concat(val);
  }, []);
}

console.log(flatten([1, [2, [3]]])); 
// [1, 2, 3]
```

---

# ✅ 3. Using `JSON` trick (not recommended)

```js
JSON.parse("[" + arr.toString() + "]");
```

❌ Breaks on objects, `null`, empty items.

---

# ⭐ Summary

* **Array flattening** → turning nested arrays into a single-level array.
* **Best method**: `arr.flat(Infinity)`
* Can also be done using recursion or `reduce()`.
